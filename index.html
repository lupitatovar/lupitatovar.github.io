							<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
							<p> I am a fifth year <b>NSF GRFP graduate student</b> in the Astronomy & Astrobiology dual-title PhD program at the University of Washington. I broadly work at the intersection of stellar variability and exoplanet research. 
								My work with <a href="https://jradavenport.github.io/">Dr. James R.A. Davenport</a> uses data from <i>Kepler</i> and <i>TESS</i> to model the morphology of white-light flares on active low mass stars. 
								I am broadly interested in how stellar activity influences our ability to both detect and characterize exoplanets. <a href="#research">Explore research.</a>
									
							</p>
							
							<p> I received my Bachelor's of Science degree in Astronomy with a minor in Physics. During my time as an undergrad, I was able to study abroad in Italy and particiapte in an archeoastronomy research project. 
								I also conducted research at UW through the Pre-MAP program & McNair Program. In addition, I spent a summer doing research at the Harvard Center for Astrophysics through the Banneker Institute Summer Program. <a href="G_Tovar_CV_Aug21.pdf" target="_blank">Explore CV.</a>  </p>

							<p> My current research broadly lies at the intersection of <b>stellar variability and its impact on planet detection and characterization</b>. 
								Specifically, I am using <i>Kepler</i> and <i>TESS</i> data to build a flare template that will help us understand the morphology of white-light flares.
								Throughout my career I have worked on a number of research projects that have spanned various astronomical subfields including but not limited to: exoplanet atmospheric modeling, time series photometry, and archeoastronomy.
								As a graduate student in the Astrobiology dual-title PhD program I have also done field work and participated in the program's astrobiology relevant field trips.</p>
